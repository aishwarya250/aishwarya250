I am result-oriented and data-driven strategic business partner, focused on analytics at the intersection of science and technology. I have been spearheaded to improve analytical operations while working with teams as well as individually to help in the organizations' growth and also to identify new models to streamline business processes. I am working with SQL, Python, and Tableau. I have used Python to do data wrangling, data merging, and to find insights from the data.
